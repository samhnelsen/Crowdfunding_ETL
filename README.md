# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this project, Greg and Sam built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After we transformed the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

You'll find the ETL pipeline in the Starter_Files folder in a Jupyter notebook called ETL_Mini_Project_SNelsen_GWick.ipynb, our table schema also in the Starter_Files folder in a doc called crowdfunding_db_schema.sql. Our 4 csvs are in the Resources folder.
